== ABOUT ==

This is basically the design I created for the host blog of the Sandbox Designs Competition, http://www.sndbx.org/.

There you will find all sorts of excellent Sandbox designs available for download. A great place to start if you're interested in customizing the Sandbox. 


== USING THIS DESIGN ==

To use the SNDBX design with the Sandbox, simply replace everything after the commented-out header in the root style.css file with

	@import url('sandbox-sndbx/sndbx-style.css');
