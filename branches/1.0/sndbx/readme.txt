== ABOUT SNDBX ==

The SNDBX design was developed by SCOTT ALLAN WALLICK for the blog of the SANDBOX DESIGNS COMPETITION, http://www.sndbx.org/.

SNDBX is muted design with subtle design details to partition sections of content. It's been designed to help structure the content and be easy to read and navigate. As per the norm with SCOTT, it is a minimalist take on design.

The icons in the /images/ folder are the lovely FamFamFam Silk icon set, http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/.


** VERY IMPORTANT **
=> To use a Sandbox theme template, the Sandbox theme must be installed.


== INSTALLING THE SANDBOX ==

The Sandbox theme is included with WordPress. To get the Sandbox, visit http://wordpress.org/download/.


== INSTALLING A THEME TEMPLATE ==

A theme template is installed just like any other WordPress theme.

	1. Extract the /sndbx/ folder from the archive
	2. Upload this folder and its contents to the ../wp-content/themes/
		* The file structure should be: ../wp-content/themes/sndbx/style.css
	3. The design will now appear in the Dashboard > Presentation menu

You can read more detailed installation instructions on the WordPress Codex.
