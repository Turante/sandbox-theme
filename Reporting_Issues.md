# How to File and Issue #

Issues include bugs (defects), feature requests (enhancements), suggestions (patch), to-do's (tasks), or the ubiquitous 'other'.

I strongly encourage anyone to file any type of issue described above. To help in the process of addressing your issue, please read this _before_ filing an issue. When you file an issue, you will choose one of the issue types above. These are important.

Before filing an issue, however, consider:

  * Does this agree with the minimalist philosophy behind the theme? (No bloat)
  * Is this plugin behavior or theme behavior? Why not a plugin?
  * Does your request simply fulfill a personal need, or one for most users?

But it's better to suggest something that isn't incorporated instead of keeping it to yourself. Read on!

## Bugs (Defects) ##

These are the things that make the Sandbox break. These are measurably bad, like sand in a camera lens. A bug is something that absolutely 100% of users will say, "Yes! That's awful."

When you report a bug, select _Type=Defect_ below the issue reporting box. Please describe this bug as accurately and as detailed as possible. Include line numbers from the theme files, if possible.

## Feature Requests (Enhancements) ##

These are actually fun. These are the things that are like bugs, but because they don't affect how the theme _works_, they're not. Plus, maybe not everyone will agree with you. Yes, your feature request might be cool, but it also might not be appropriate with the goals of the Sandbox.

By nature, feature requests should have a lower priority. Please don't post a feature request and label it "Critical." That's silly. Explain your vision, share how we can make it happen, and the discussion will ensue.

## Suggestions (Patch) ##

Any suggestions of how we can improve, build, trim, etc., the Sandbox are heartily welcomed. Please. When you make a suggestion, you'll need to include a patch most likely. If you don't know how to patch a file, please see [How to Patch WordPress](http://asymptomatic.net/2005/12/03/2142/how-to-patch-wordpress/). Instead of WordPress, you'll be doing it with the Sandbox. Same process.

## Other ##

Sigh. This could be anything. But please do not post an 'other' issue unless the given issue tags above simply don't apply. Thanks.

Issues are essentially bugs, feature requests, or suggestions that you believe should be incorporated into the theme. Anyone (with a Google account) may file an issue and it will be tracked accordingly. It's simple.
