== ABOUT BLUEBERRY ==

The BLUEBERRY design was developed by DEAN ROBINSON for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

BLUEBERRY is a dark theme, based around a dark blue background with Green header and highlghts.
Overall its a fairly minimalist design, with few images used, and the majority of styling done
purely through the CSS.

Icons are from the brilliant FamFamFam Silk icon set. http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/
