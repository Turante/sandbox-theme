== ABOUT SCRAPPR ==

A simple, fun tumblog theme with fancy-schmancy custom article styles.
- Elastic Layout: resize the text, and the design resizes with it!
- Stellar typography: makes your writing look gooood.

Use one of these special categories on a post for special article styles.
  * Photo: gives a nifty note look.
  * Video: ditto
  * Note, or Tip: looks like a sticky note.
  * Podcast: adds a podcast icon.
  * Quote: big chunky text and quote marks.
  * Links, or Linklist, or Link: bigger text.

You can easily change the header/footer background images with a change to only one line of code in style.css.

Scrappr was developed by Gordon Brander for the Sandbox Designs Competition, with the Taffy CSS Framework (http://www.gordonbrander.com/taffy-framework)
