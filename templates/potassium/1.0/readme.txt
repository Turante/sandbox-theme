== ABOUT POTASSIUM ==

The POTASSIUM design was developed by DANIEL TAN for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

Potassium is my first public WordPress theme to be distributed, and is based on the highly semantic Sandbox theme. I called it Potassium because of its light grey/silver color scheme which is similar to the otherwise reactive metal.
