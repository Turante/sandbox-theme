== ABOUT ESSAY ==

The ESSAY design was developed by IAN STEWART for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

Essay is sort of old english for a small start or an attempt. So here it is, my first attempt at a design met for public consumption and use, ESSAY. It has a few failings but it also has a few things I think are pretty decent.

The main stylesheet, style.css, imports a series of sheets that can be taken apart and customized to one's heart's content. In fact, there's actually two themes here. The first is built up out of reset.css, type.css, structure.css and theme.css. By itself this theme is my own personal "Minima" (An almost perfect theme IMHO). On top of this I've added support for CSS-only asides and a groovier look in extra.css.
