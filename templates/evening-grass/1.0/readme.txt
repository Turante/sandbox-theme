= ABOUT EVENING-GRASS =

The design was developed by Stephen Broughton for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

= AUTHOR'S NOTES =

I decided for this theme I should have something a little more colourful, a few images and a bit of a variation in colour. They told me red and blue don't go, but I showed 'em! It doesn't have a sidebar, that is true. I think it's a bit of a hindrance and doesn't really have a vital purpose.

Feel free to put it back in by removing ".sidebar" from the CSS list that is set to "display: none" in the style.css file. However, be warned, it won't look pretty, and it won't be on the side. Some tweaking and designing may therefore be in order before implementing this design if you like sidebars!
