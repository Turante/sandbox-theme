/* About the skin */

The Blue Butterfly Layout is so called because, guess what? It features blue butterflies. This means I will not make recolours, however sweetly you ask. It's GPL, do them yourself. All the brushes used to create the graphics were made from my own photographs, including a wrap dress I sold for my sister on ebay, and some doodles I made in the pub. That was more information than you needed, but hey. 

The CSS validates apart from one microscopic IE6-pandering hack. It has been tested in: Mozilla Firefox 2, Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Opera 9, and the Safari beta for Windows. If you want me to test on a Mac, buy me one. (That was a joke. I know seeking remuneration for wordpress themes is the height of evil.)

IE6 may break short Pages if you put multiple widgets in sidebar 1. It is entirely up to you whether you care about the whims of that ridiculous excuse for a browser, I'm just mentioning it to you so you don't complain about it to me.
