WordPress themes competition. For the WordPress community (GPL), enjoy it you humble gypsy tinker tramps.

==================================================================
Minimal changes were made to the style.css sheet.

Only two images are included -- bg.jpg and logo.jpg

The Pagoda Theme is easily customized by the end user as the necessary changes are small
    in the Sandbox Installation.  One only has to edit colors and use a simple
    graphics program to change the logo.jpg file to suit.
