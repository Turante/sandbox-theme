= AUTHOR'S NOTES =

While I was making this theme, I tried to keep at the forefront of my mind that many web users are no longer drawn to flashy websites and bright colours. More generated content is now acquired through feeds and much of the formatting put in use is lost. It is the unfortunate truth that while designers put in a lot of effort to make their websites attractive, their labour is all too often overlooked. However, attention has now been drawn towards making sites accessible and easy to read.

Sandbox and WordPress have sorted out the first of these: the design is intuitive and easy to navigate. My design is meant to be easy to read. Many professional bloggers will be familiar with the layout and might argue that nothing has changed in my theme. However, my theme is different in that in both the typography and the colour scheme, even the most tired eyes will appreciate the clarity of the text. This is achieved by a greater line-height, narrower columns and medium-contrast between the text and the background.
