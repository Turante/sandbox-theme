== ABOUT Moo-Point ==

The Moo-Point design was developed by Will Wilkins for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

The design of Moo-Point is so simple, it is just like a cow's opinion. It's moo!  See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLwYpSCrlHU for a better understanding.

Moo-Point is based on a two-column layout with header navigation and a right-hand sidebar.  The theme is meant to be easy to read with shades of gray and brown for a little color.
