- About Modernistic

The design was developed by W. Andrew Shogren for the Sandbox Designs Competition and is based off of an un-released theme which should come out soon.
This theme is designed as a no-image theme for fast loading times and yet still be aesthetically pleasing. It purposely makes use of white space and many different colors
to give a distinct feel to the theme to make it memorable.
