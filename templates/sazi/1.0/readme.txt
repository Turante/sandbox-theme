The SAZI design was developed by Krusty Ruffle for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

SAZI is a rather simple design with a dark slate and solder background and an electrified 'enlightenment' Kanji glyph logo.

It is designed to be dial-up friendly, yet still pleasing to the eye, hence the use of .jpg's instead of .png's.

The size could be reduced further with properly optimized CSS in the style sheet, but I have opted to leave it in a fairly readable form.
