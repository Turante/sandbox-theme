== ABOUT CERULEUS ==

Thanks for downloading; I hope you enjoy the theme.

== NOTES ==

This theme has been tested on Windows under IE 6, IE 7, FireFox, Safari, and Opera. I am unable to test this theme under OSX because I do not have access to an Apple computer. If you find any bugs, please let me know in the comments of the Ceruleus
 download page above.


With the exception of one line, this theme is valid CSS 2.1. The only exception to this is the line which applies "text-shadow: 0 0 0 #000;" to the body of the theme. This is designed to compensate for variances in Safari font-rendering. You can read more about this technique at http://24ways.org/2006/knockout-type

This technique has no effect on other browsers and is also valid CSS 3.
