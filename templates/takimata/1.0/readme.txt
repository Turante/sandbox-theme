== ABOUT TAKIMATA ==

The TAKIMATA design was developed by ROBERT ELLIS for the Sandbox Designs Competition.

Do blogs have to look like blogs? TAKIMATA is designed to be a departure from busy, brightly colored themes. Easy on the eyes, with subdued hues and readable font-sizes, TAKIMATA is perfect for blogs where content takes precedence over clutter.
