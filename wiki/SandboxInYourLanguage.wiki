= Introduction =

Existing translations are included with stable releases.
To use the translations follow the general Wordpress [http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language instructions for setting another language]. Once you have set the desired language, the corresponding language should apply on the Sandbox theme as well (if language files were provided in our zip).

The following provides information on how to create your own translations. You might want to check with us or the trunk (next version) before you start translating to make sure that a translation is not forthcoming.

*Please submit your translations when finished!*

For the unexperienced: the following rough guide is provided. 
If you are experienced use the provided sandbox.pot file in http://sandbox-theme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.

==How to translate to your own language?==

  # Read up on and refer to the general Wordpress instructions at: http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress
  # The file you need to translate is called sandbox.pot, it is included in the plugin download or found in http://sandbox-theme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ if you plan to help out for the next version of Sandbox
  # Use this file to create you own human readable file ({{{*}}}.po) and machine readable file ({{{*}}}.mo) with the correct country code in the name (e.g. fr_FR.mo). (One easy to use tool for this is Poedit - http://www.poedit.net) 
  # Place the translation file in the Sandbox theme directory.
  # Once you have finalized your translation please inform the project so we can include for others to use!
