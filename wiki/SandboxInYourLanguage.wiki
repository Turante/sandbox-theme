The following provides information on how to create your own translations.

For the unexperienced: the following rough guide is provided. 
If you are experienced use the provided sandbox.pot file in trunk or corresponding version from the SVN/Source section here.

==How to translate to your own language?==

  # See the general Wordpress instructions at: http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress
  # The file you need to translate in this case is called sandbox.pot, this file is included in the plugin download zip package
  # Use this file to create you own human readable file (*.po) and machine readable file (*.mo) with the correct country code in the name (e.g. fr_FR.mo)
  # Place the translation file in the Sandbox theme directory.
  # Once you have finalized your translation please inform the project!
