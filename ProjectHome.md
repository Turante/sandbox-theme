## About the Sandbox ##

The Sandbox is a theme for themers. It has the ability to be easily skinned, so beginners will feel comfortable styling it since they only need to know CSS.

More experienced designers will drool at the rich semantic markup and profusion of classes, dynamically generated by a few functions.

Sandbox is a lot of things:

  * Beautiful on the inside
  * Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional
  * Widgets friendly
  * The basis for your GPL-licensed theme

More importantly, the Sandbox can be a lot of things.

What began as [Scott's](http://www.plaintxt.org/) leftovers has become an advanced, semantics-based theme. [Andy](http://andy.wordpress.com/) added his innovative semantic class-generating functions and Scott edited it to oblivion.

So what can you do with the Sandbox?

  * You can just use it as-is and have a super-cool, truly minimalist theme.
  * You can thoroughly customize it with CSS alone.
  * You can use its functions, files, et al, as pleases you.
  * You can use it to learn a few things about CSS, XHTML, and PHP.

The real feature of the Sandbox is its markup. The use of class-generating functions in the `body`, post `div`, and comment/trackback `li` elements create an exceptionally extensible foundation.

As Andy said, "Given straightforward markup with plenty of selectors, there isn't much that can't be accomplished with CSS and a decent browser."

And the implementation of the [hAtom](http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom) and [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) microformats means we're looking forward. You might be able to improve on our markup, but, well, who wants to work that hard?
